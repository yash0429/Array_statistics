#This is assignment : Week 1

This project involves implementing statistical analysis functions for an array of data in C programming language. The stats.c file contains the implementation of these functions, while the stats.h file provides function declarations and documentation.

# Implementation Details
Functions in stats.c
- main(): This is the main entry point for the program.
- print_statistics(): Prints the statistics of an array including minimum, maximum, mean, and median.
- print_array(): Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the screen.
- find_median(): Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value.
- find_mean(): Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean.
- find_maximum(): Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum.
- find_minimum(): Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum.
- sort_array(): Given an array of data and a length, sorts the array from largest to smallest.

# Header File (stats.h)
The stats.h header file includes declarations and documentation for the functions from the stats.c file. Each function declaration is accompanied by comments providing a description of the function, inputs, and return value.

# Usage
Include the stats.h header file in your main program file where statistical analysis is required.
Call the required statistical analysis functions by passing the array of data and its length as parameters.
Use the returned values or printed statistics as needed for further analysis or display.

# Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to submit bug fixes, optimizations, or additional features via pull requests.
