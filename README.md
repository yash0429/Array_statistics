#This is assignment : Week 1

In this programming assignment we will create a simple application that performs statistical analytics on a dataset. This assignment will help us to get re-oriented with c-programming syntax and host machine compilation.

We'll  write a couple of functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set.
